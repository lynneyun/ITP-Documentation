# Research Project: A Lifelong, Continuous, Nonhierarchical Model of Learning
	
_Lynne, it was a great pleasure to have you in class this semester. For this project, I think your observations about the relationships between novices and experts, and about the questions of finding communities, with learning as a second-order goal, were especially interesting._

_I'll put some italicized comments inline, headed by CS:, and add some comments at the end. -clay_

## Background

Continuing to learn after a formal educational environment is a challenge for many people, myself included. In a formal setting, there is often a secluded environment where cohorts of students are allowed to experiment, fail, and share learned experiences. Upon graduation, often people lose this sheltered environment. _CS: This question of what the environment of school gives us -- a set of norms (including peer pressure), a place to fail, an expectation to persist -- is underappreciated in the literature on auto-didacticism._ Although the desire for learning is still there, people are left in the dark, wondering how they could actively continue learning.  


### Common pathways of adult learning (and their failures):

(Note: These list conscious, intentional learning, and does not include unconscious learning)
_CS: You might find some value in further breaking out intentional learning into task- and learning-concious varieties. My learning to change a tire is conscious and intentional, but also task-oriented._

* Continuing Education Courses via Institutions:
	* Often surface level due to not enough common ground of expertise

	_CS: OK, long comment about "surface level", not about this basic observation, which is correct, but rather about how to turn it into something you can work with:_
	
	_One of the hardest things to do ihn thinking about your own thinking is thinking about where you are letting yourself get sloppy. Writing is one of the best technologies we have for making ourselves think carefully, but even that discipline requires watching out for places where you are accepting vagueness when there would be beneifit in specificity._
	
	_I struggle with this all the time, and one of the few things I've found that reliably helps is looking for words or phrases that are evocative but not actually descriptive. "Surface level" is one of those. You are right in the general characterization, but think back to our class -- our first meeting was also "surface level", because where else or we going to start. Something keeps those classes from proceeding beyond the basics. What do you think it is?_
	
	* Hierarchical learning model (teacher/student) is not conducive to continued learning after course ends
* Conferences:
	* Often focused on networking as opposed to learning 
	_CS: I'm not convinced this is true; it might be more correctly descriptive to say something less transactional than 'networking', like 'coimmunity membership', or even 'company.'_
	* Distracting environment
	_CS: Surely less distracting than Workplace, below, no?_
	* Information is bite-sized/brief
* Workplace:
	* Priority is usually on commercial output 
	* 'Being on the clock' discourages novel/experimental approaches
	* Motivation for learning can be stunted by external forces (clients, deadlines, coworkers, etc)

## Research Topic

**How can we continue to engage in active learning after higher education?**

* How can we learn in meaningful ways from our peers?
* What research/documentation has been done before in this area, and what can we learn from it?

## Learnings from Research

#### Reframing Learning

As I started to dig into the research, I realized that I had bypassed a fundamental stage: I needed to reframe my assumptions of the process of learning itself. 

![Medicine Wheel](img/Research_img1.png)

I found David Cowan’s paper on *Rhythms of Learning* and its explanation to the Native American medicine wheel very helpful. It represents integrative learning, and sets up a foundation for lifelong learning.

These cycles portray how learning is a recurrent process, one that can potentially spiral to higher levels of development with each passage around the wheel. It reinforces the belief that one is in the ever-learning process all the time.

#### What Learning Should Not Look Like

![Linear Learning](img/Research_img2.png)
David Cowan argues that this is how American education looks like where learning is regarded as something that is a convergent path, and thus has a linear direction. He argues that a much more holistic way of learning is the circular path depicted in the medicine wheel, where the path can oscillate more from novice to expert.

#### Dynamic Learning 
![Dynamic Learning](img/Research_img3.png)
So if we were to look at a dimensional version of the medicine wheel, it’s more like a spiraling climb. This circularity allows a learner to go through stages of being a novice to an expert, and then start over again while acknowledging that one is continually evolving. And in this ascent there are stages: information, knowledge, and wisdom. I find this very applicable to the information age we’re in, because it’s relatively easy to gather information from the internet, but to digest it as our own knowledge we need experience in order to go climb this spiral.

_CS: Information, Knowledge, Wisdom is an appealing set of labels, but their use in English defeats any easy way to relate or nest them. Perhaps most importantly, information is a property of systems, and knowledge a property of people. There can be information no one knows -- some number of raindrops will fall on the roof of Bobst in the next hour, but no one will ever know that number. By contrast, there can't be knowledge no one knows -- it's an oxymoron. So don't get too distracted by the neatness of the I/K/W ladder._

#### The Concept of the Expert Novice

I encountered an intriguing keyword through my research: An "expert novice".

**Expert novice**

* “Expert novices are those who are sound masters of the procedures needed to learn new things” (Miles, 1998). 

_CS: This should be chiseled over the marble arch leading into ITP..._

* “Within a network of expert novices, only the essential skills of learning become automatized over time, and perhaps even those are reconsidered periodically.”

And perhaps, this is what the mindset of the learner should be. 

#### Community

_CS: From my pov, this is the most fruitful thing from this project, and there a lot of interesting work in identifying and clustering the characteristics and motivations of different communities._

The importance of community cannot be understated in the larger context. We are all parts of communities, and the biggest opportunities for learning are often in social contexts. 
This is an area where I encountered a lot of roadblock — I had a difficult time trying to find examples of communities that focused on learning that wasn’t overly related to corporate or political endeavors. What I did find out and found interesting, are these:

* **Communities of practice**: These are communities where there is an identity defined by a shared domain of interest, and the participants are practitioners. I was able to find a lot of literature on the subject, but where it falls short is that the applications are often about commercial enterprises like making task forces in a company.

_CS: {sigh} This is true, but a perversion of the original Wenger work on CoP: the original model involved practitioners who were not employed by the same firm._

* **DIY Communities**: These communities are formed as an effort to be independent from what they regard to be mainstream. Popular examples include democratic schools, free schools, and hippy communities. Where these fall short is the lack of documentation and direction, aside from their anti-establishment nature.

_CS: This category seems to include everything from Sudbury Valley to Ravelry -- this seems like a target for further differentiation._

* **Talking Circles**: In *Using the Medicine Wheel for Curriculum Design in Intercultural Communication: Rethinking Learning Outcomes* by Marcella LaFever, it talks about indigenous Talking Circles in the context of decolonizing education in Canada. The basic premise is that there is a purposeful idea and theme to the gathering, and everyone talks in a circle, uninterrupted. It focuses on integrative conversation, which involves the exchange and creation of new meaning and feelings of cohesion. 

Where I feel a bit lost about all of these concepts and cases is that the idea seems promising — but I’m a bit unsure how it can apply to the day to day function of being part of a learning community. 

_CS: If you do any more with this work, this is your problem statement..._

#### Integrating the Individual and Community

![Dynamic Learning](img/Research_img4.png)
Coming back to the idea of the medicine wheel, it would be ideal to consolidate the best practices of the individual and combine it with the concept of the community. My vision for how this can be done is still quite opaque, but in my ideal world this is what the individual and community for learning would be like. Each individual is on their own spiral learning journey, and there is a larger spiral that consists of the community as a whole, implying that the community itself is also learning as the individuals within it are doing the same. 

_CS: The spiral metaphor seems almost custom-made for noting that a group of individuals spiraling together will intersect at some points and not others, and that coordinating these overlaps is key._

## Feedback and Thoughts

I think it would be an understatement to say that many people recognize the value of learning, whether it be conscious or unconscious learning. In Clay's class, we often spoke about how learning is solidified by reflection, and how feedback is crucial in that process.

Here are some questions that came up, and thoughts in relation.

* A lot of the questions that came up while I was seeking feedback was the intended audience / target of the project. While I perceive the research to be a more broader sense, for the sake of focus I decided to concentrate on learning beyond formal education (college level and beyond).

* The concept of the medicine wheel was met with a lot of agreement. It seems that many people were intrigued by the ever evolving concept of the wheel. How this can actually be applied in a habitual/systematic sense (or if it even should be attempted) is unclear.

* The findability of learning in the meta sense can be difficult to implement even in academic institutions (e.g. "Learning how to learn"), since many people focus on the task or problem at hand instead.

_CS: One downside of the full weight of institutional learning, now running from ages 3-30 for many people, is that the idea of learning outside an insitutional context is seen as an oddball choice in many cases, **even though people do it all the time**._ _Meanwhile, on many communities that are obviously centered on learning, they keep labels like teaching or learning out of their names, because of a risk of association with the negative aspects of the institutional experience._

_CS: Last note. In addition to the above, I just wanted to say, since I am not technically ITP faculty, that you should feel free to request office hours in your last semester if that is useful for your thesis or applications or work post-ITP, and should you need a letter of recommendation, I would be delighted to write one on your behalf. -clay_

## Potential for Further Research

In the era of the pandemic, we are realizing that online meetups and conferences can be organized by anyone. These learnings can be beneficial in current times where digital conferences/meetups can be hosted by any individual/group.

Ideally, the research would be taken further to a state where the learnings can be adapted to create a virtual learning environment. Examples of these would include: Virtual community skillshares, digital residencies where participants are both student and educator, and asynchronous learning curriculums.

# Acceleration Vectors

## Documentation for Week 2 of NYU ITP's Nature of Code Class 

This week, [Nature of Code](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-syllabus-S21) classes covered vectors. I guess I had skipped ahead a bit by choosing to tackle the homework based on Diffusion-Limited Aggregation! While last week was a lot to wrap my head around, this week was easier in comparison.

After watching through the list of core materials, I decided to do something with mouse interaction since that looked like an interesting topic.

While I was looking for ways to combine what I had learned from last week, I figured out that I could potentially also 'send back' the movers by adding an origin point vector. And voila! I was able to make a series of animated vectors. 

I especially found a lot of delight in being able to sweep up my 'worries' as can be seen in the animated GIF below.

# Force

## Documentation for Week 3 of NYU ITP's Nature of Code Class 

This week, [Nature of Code](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-syllabus-S21) classes covered forces. 

Following along with the tutorials, I was mesmerized at how you could make particles attract (or repel)! 


For the assignment, I decided to continue on the theme of the 'worry' word that I have started, and imported the words to make the 'attractor'. Then, I figured I would try to connect all the lines in a curve to simulate being a 'bundle of worries'.

I think aesthetically the dots are more pleasing, but the curved lines represent the worries pretty well.

If given more time, I would like to make the interaction slower and 'worries' respond more intimately to the user interaction.

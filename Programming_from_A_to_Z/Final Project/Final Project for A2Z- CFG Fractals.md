### To Do Next:

* Read *[An Introduction to Fractals](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/fracintro/)* by Paul Bourke
* Watch the TED Talk [Fractals: a world in a grain of sand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHNooAe44dY) by Ben Weiss


### Questions:
* It seems that Dan has an exercise that seems to imply that individual parts can be moved, is this for non-CFG fractals or can this be applied to CFG fractals as well? And on a related note, is it possible to keep track of each 'branching' point (or is it impractical with CFG)?

## Thoughts about Learning
[scene 1: Title slide & Intro]

Learning is something we engage in our everyday lives, yet it is something we may not be thinking about in a conscious manner. I'm not only referring to studying in a classroom or reading a how-to book; I'm talking about all the times we have tried to improve upon something. The mini story arcs of "exposition, rising action, climax, and resolution" that we experience on a daily basis. I consider myself as a lifelong learner and passionate about being a learner and educator; however it occurred to me that I usually never express the emotional aspects of learning that I go through. So for this project, I am trying to creatively express those thoughts.
